# SkySpectral
A simple tool to process multispectral images from the Micasense RedEdge-P

Coming next:
- Pan sharpening algorithm
- Agisoft automated workflow
- Image annotation

## Introduction
SkySpectral is a simple tool for visualizing and processing multispectral imagery. It enables the alignment and combination of various sub-images (bands) to extract relevant data.

    Processing multispectral image, from a folder
</p>


## Principle
The functionalities include:
- Import Micasense output folder
- Visualize bands with standard matplotlib color palettes
- Align channels (R,G,B,NIR,Red-Edge) to Pan-chromatic with an intuitive interface (especially critical for close-shots, as in building fa√ßades analyses)
- Visualize composed shot (RGB image re-composed from individual channels, CIR - Color Infrared, etc.)
- Create custom indices based on arithmetic operations on bands
- Access typical vegetation indices such as NDVI
- Prepare the files for Agisoft Metashape (organize images in folders)
- ...
